                        Oak Cliff History
                      </h2>
                      <p class="mb-4">
                        Named for large oak trees lining cliffs, Oak Cliff was established in 1887 by Thomas L. Marsalis and John S. Armstrong and incorporated as a city in 1891 and later annexed by the city of Dallas in 1903. Located across the Trinity River and two miles from the city center, Oak Cliff has retained several of its original neighborhoods including Lake Cliff, Kidd Springs, Kessler Park, Kings Highway, Winnetka Heights, and Wynnewood to name a few. Oak Cliff flourished with businesses, parks, amusements parks, theaters, schools and churches, a hospital, and the first 7-Eleven store over the years. The area underwent transformation after “white flight” in the sixties, with immigrants, Latinos and Black people moving into the neighborhoods and business corridors in the seventies. In the nineties, there was redevelopment in certain areas including Bishop Arts District, Jefferson Boulevard, and Davis Street – Davis Street also known as Highway 80 was a part of a national route that took travelers to Fort Worth. Bishop Arts was started by Jim Lake Sr. whose first tenant was the sculptor Stu Kraft who attracted other artists to the area – thus, Bishop Arts as its shortened name.

                        class="wrappedImage"
                      />
                        In the early 1900s, an artist and well-known premier painter of the American West,
Frank Reaugh, is credited with attracting a cadre of painters and sculptors to Oak Cliff.
Reaugh established the Dallas Arts Society now known as the Dallas Museum of Art
and the Dallas Creative Arts Society. Jefferson Boulevard is home to the Texas Theater,
Oak Cliff Cultural Center, a city-owned cultural center, and many Latino businesses. The
Oak Cliff Society of Fine Arts, co-founded by Frank Reaugh in 1926, continues to
present a diverse variety of art, music, and dance programs to residents throughout
Dallas County at its home, Turner House, located within the boundaries of the proposed
Oak Cliff Cultural District. 
                      </p>
                      <p class="mb-4">
                        Today, Oak Cliff encompasses a large swath of Dallas, located in the South and
Southwest areas of the city with more than 330,000 residents. One of the leading nonprofit organizations in Oak Cliff, Heritage Oak Cliff, founded in 1975, focuses on
strengthening and preserving the rich beauty of more than thirty unique member
neighborhoods. They are also a grantor for conservation, beautification, and
preservation projects and other projects that enhance each neighborhood. Because
Oak Cliff is a large area in southern Dallas, our proposed Oak Cliff Cultural District
would be a gateway to the arts and culture scene found in abundance throughout Oak
Cliff.
                      </p>
                      <p class="mb-4">Discussions began in early 2022 that the organic buildup of the Jefferson Boulevard,
                        Davis Street, and Bishop Arts District areas would make for a well-defined cultural
                        district. Jefferson with its mix of Latino retailers and cultural events; Bishop Arts with
                        more than 40 decades of eclecticism and Bohemian mix, and Davis with its complete
                        street redevelopment – all areas bustling with restaurants, retailers, public art, historic
                        oak cliff cultural district letter of intent
                        structures, and attractions all come together to celebrate and promote some spectacular
                        “tent-pole” events enjoyed by the thousands throughout the footprint. 
                        </p>
                      <p class="mb-4"><em>Several artists and non-profit arts organizations along with civic leaders and organizations including the Oak Cliff Chamber of Commerce, Visit Dallas, The Office of
                        Arts and Culture for the City of Dallas, local businesses, and neighborhood associations
                        have realized how this footprint is the ideal candidate for Texas’ next cultural district.</em></p>
